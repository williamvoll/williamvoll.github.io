# Walter Carmo's Portfolio Website

This is a repo for my personal portfolio website ([Stryk3r.com](https://www.stryk3r.com)). 

~~Originally built in PHP, reworked for GitHub Pages.~~

Built custom using Jekyll with no theme. (Disclaimer, I did use a CSS Framework... Bootstrap.)

My portfolio site contains a write up of my abilities / services, things I have built, a testimonial from a former boss, and a little blurb about myself.

Things I have built:
- [Web Applications](https://www.stryk3r.com/#portfolio)
- [Websites](https://www.stryk3r.com/#websites)
- [Data Visualizations](https://www.stryk3r.com/##dashboards)
- [Graphics](https://www.stryk3r.com/#webdesign)
- [Excel Spreadsheets](https://www.stryk3r.com/##dashboards)

I am available for hire. 

Contact me via the [email form on my portfolio](https://www.stryk3r.com/#contact) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-carmo-0082611a4/) for more information.
